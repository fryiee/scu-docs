# Creating and editing a route

Routes are used to assign a group of bookings to a day, for generating a map and order for drivers to collect.

Routes can be access from the `Drivers, Trucks and Routes` dropdown in the navigation menu.

You can create a route for tomorrow after the cutoff time specified in the `Settings` section. If possible, the `Create route for tomorrow` button in the routes section will bring 
you to the Create Route form.

 Once on the Create Route form, you are presented with a map of all the bookings for the day, as well as the currently assigned bookings and the dropdown list of available shifts for the day.
